# SBDynT
We are developing a well-documented, open-source Python package, the Small Body Dynamics Tool (SBDynT), that can be used to calculate a variety of dynamical parameters and determine dynamical characterizations and classifications from integrations of a solar system small bodyâ€™s orbital evolution.

### Current state of development
We are in the very early stages of development, primarily focusing on adding individual functions that will later be incoporated into a larger work-flow. Functions currently available are show in the demonstration notebook in the example-notebooks directory
