# SBDynT
Small Bodies Dynamics Tool

# Long term goal
We are developing a well-documented, open-source Python package, the Small Body Dynamics Tool (SBDynT), that can be used to calculate a variety of dynamical parameters and determine dynamical characterizations and classifications from integrations of a solar system small bodyâ€™s orbital evolution.
